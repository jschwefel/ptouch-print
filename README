About:

ptouch-print is a command line tool to print labels on Brother P-Touch
printers on Linux.

There is no need to install the printer via CUPS, the printer is accessed
directly via libusb.

The tool was written for and tested with the PT-2430PC, but meanwhile is also
used with others (see "ptouch-print --list-supported")
Maybe others work too (please report USB VID and PID so I can include support
for further models, too).

Compile instructions:

./build.sh

Note:

Dear visitor, currently I have absolutely no time for improvements on this
project (my free time currently is about one or two hours PER MONTH).
Therefore, I can not look at suggestions about improvements.
